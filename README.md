# Work-Porfolio



- The motivation I had to create this project was to let any potenital employer see all the skill I have to offer and also let them know 
the value I offer to there company/team. This motivated me to dig deep into my skill I've learn threw the years of highschool and some 
parts of college.
- I build this project to help me in my future career path as softward developer and also put my current work experiences out there for 
potential employers.
- The problem that this project solved for me in general was to take a big step into creating a start-up portolio so my future employers can 
look at. 
- I learn a few things wwhich are, I need to study a bit more on CSS mainly on my tags in my html and then creating them in the CSS. I need to 
be more orginized on my CSS going from top to bottom.

        Installation 
step 1: Go to github 
step 2: open the html link 
step 3: look over my Work portolio 
step 4: Look at the CSS work and How I created design
